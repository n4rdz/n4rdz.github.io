                    <div class="ref_item">
                        <P class="description">· Josh Dun was born in Columbus, Ohio, and comes from a family of six with two sisters, Ashley and Abigail, and a brother, Jordan. At a young age, Dun taught himself how to play drums.[1] Dun recalls that he was not allowed to listen to secular music in his childhood, but would often sneak to the music store and ask for suggestions. "I'd hide albums like Green Day's Dookie under my bed. Sometimes they'd find them and get real mad. They'd find a Christian alternative like Relient K and make me listen to that." Dun worked at the Guitar Center alongside former Twenty One Pilots drummer Chris Salih, through whom he would eventually meet Tyler Joseph.</P>
